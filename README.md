## Project Description
This project is a web application designed for gym management, providing an easy and efficient way for users and trainers to interact.
- **Regular users** can create an account, log in securely, and browse available gym activities. They can view details such as schedules, fees, and the number of available slots. Once a session is booked, users can track their upcoming activities and manage their reservations.
- **Trainers** have dedicated accounts that allow them to post and manage activities. They can set session times, determine the number of available slots, and specify pricing. Trainers can also update or cancel activities as needed, ensuring a dynamic and flexible scheduling system.
- **Exercise recommendations** help users optimize their workouts by selecting a specific muscle group, after which they receive a curated list of exercises targeting that area. Each recommendation includes a brief description of the exercise, proper form instructions, and potential benefits, helping users make informed fitness decisions.

### Planned Features  
- **Google Maps integration** to locate the gym and provide directions.  
- **AI-generated gym programs** using the ChatGPT API, allowing users to receive personalized workout plans based on their fitness goals.
